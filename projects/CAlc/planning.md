### 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a functional calculator app with buttons for numbers 0-9, arithmetic operations (+, -, X, %), equals sign (=), and clear button (CE). The app should include basic arithmetic functionalities and handle user input seamlessly.

## 🎯 Core Features
1. **Main Calculator Functionality:** Perform basic mathematical operations.
2. **Number Entry:** Input numbers from 0 to 9 using buttons.
3. **Arithmetic Operations:** Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with respective buttons.
4. **Clear Button:** Reset the calculator to clear all inputs and results.

## 🏗️ Technical Approach
- **Tech Stack:** HTML5 with CSS for styling, JavaScript for logic and interactions, and possibly a backend service (e.g., Node.js and Express) for server-side processing if needed.
- **Key Files:**
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the user interface. Contains the calculator layout and scripting.
  - `styles.css`: CSS file to style the calculator components.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for number entry, arithmetic operations, and button behavior.
- **Architecture Overview:** The calculator app will consist of a single HTML page with buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, equals sign, and clear button. The logic for each operation will be implemented in JavaScript.

## ✅ Implementation Steps
1. **Set up the HTML structure:**
   - Create input fields for displaying the current calculation.
   - Add buttons for digits (0-9).
   - Implement buttons for arithmetic operations (+, -, X, %).
   - Add a button for equals sign (=).
   - Add a button for clear button (CE).

2. **Style the calculator:**
   - Use CSS to style the calculator components such as input fields, buttons, and background patterns.

3. **Add JavaScript logic:**
   - Write JavaScript functions to handle the number entry, arithmetic operations, and button behavior.
   - Ensure that user input is validated and displayed correctly in the input field.

4. **Test the app:**
   - Test the calculator app on different browsers to ensure compatibility with backdrop-filter support for the blur effect.
   - Verify that all features work as expected and handle inputs gracefully.

## 📦 Deliverables
- `index.html`: The main HTML file of the calculator app.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the calculator components.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for number entry, arithmetic operations, and button behavior.

**Requirements:**
- Ensure that all buttons are functional and clear.
- Display numbers correctly in the input field as users enter them.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations accurately.
- Handle user inputs without errors or interruptions.
- Ensure compatibility with backdrop-filter support (if necessary).
- Provide feedback for user interactions to enhance usability.
