## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to build a simple calculator app with buttons for numbers 0-9 and arithmetic operations (+, -, X, %). The calculator will provide basic functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, percentage calculation, and clear the current input.

## 🎯 Core Features

1. **Number Entry**: Users can enter numbers from 0 to 9.
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Support for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (X), and percentage (%).
3. **Clear Input Button**: Allows users to reset or clear the current input.
4. **Display Result**: The result of operations will be displayed on screen.

## 🏗️ Technical Approach

- **Tech Stack**: We will use HTML for the UI, CSS for styling, JavaScript for functionality, and possibly a library like React.js if we decide to build an advanced calculator with interactive elements.
- **Key Files**:
  - `index.html`: The main entry point of our application.
  - `styles.css`: Styles to make the calculator look user-friendly.
  - `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for implementing the calculator functionality.
- **Architecture Overview**: We will organize the code into multiple files, each responsible for a specific part of the calculator. For example, we might have a `NumberInput` component for handling number entry and an `ArithmeticOperation` component for performing calculations.

## ✅ Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Project Structure**:
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Initialize a new HTML file (`index.html`) in the root directory.
   - Create CSS files (`styles.css`) in the `css` directory.
   - Create JavaScript files (`script.js`) in the `js` directory.

2. **Define HTML Structure**:
   - In `index.html`, create a div to hold the calculator UI.
   - Add buttons for numbers (0-9) and arithmetic operations (+, -, X, %).
   - Include a display element to show the user's input and results.

3. **Style with CSS**:
   - Use CSS to style the calculator UI. Make sure the buttons are properly aligned and styled to look good on different devices.

4. **Implement JavaScript Functionality**:
   - In `script.js`, add event listeners to the buttons for number entry.
   - Implement functions to handle arithmetic operations and update the display with the results.
   - Add a clear input button that removes all entries from the display.

5. **Test the Calculator**:
   - Test the calculator thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
   - Use browser tools like Chrome DevTools to debug and fix any issues.

## 📦 Deliverables

- **index.html**: The main entry point of the calculator app.
- **styles.css**: Styles for making the calculator look user-friendly.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for implementing the calculator functionality.
- **README.md**: A detailed description of the project, its features, and setup instructions.

This plan outlines a structured approach to building a simple calculator app with clear steps and deliverables.
